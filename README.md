# Four Burner Event Organizer

Welcome to the Four Burner Event Organizer! This is a Sinatra web app that allows users to organize their schedules around the four-burner theory of work-life balance.

Users set up an account, log in, and create Events with date and duration stamps. Those events are then collated and can be seen through the lens of the four-burner pie chart. This visualization will help users get a sense of how they are spending their time in a similar way to how credit card companies use web apps to show users how they are spendiing their money.

Users can also edit and update their events later on and the burner breakdown will adjust.
